I need to write `README\\\\\\\\.md` rather than `readme.md` because `grep` treats \\\\\\\".\\\\\\\" as a special wildcard character unless I use `\\\\\\\\` to indicate that I mean it as the literal \\\\\\\".\\\\\\\" symbol.\\\\n\\\",\\n\",\n",
      "      \"    \\\"- By default `grep` looks in a single file. However, the `-r` \\\\\\\"recursive\\\\\\\" flag tells `grep` to look at every file within the specified directory, and all of its subdirectories, and all of their subdirectories, and so on.\\\\n\\\",\\n\",\n",
      "      \"    \\\"- By default, `grep` would print every line in the specified set of files that contains the sequence of characters \\\\\\\"readme.md\\\\\\\". The `-l` flag (here combined with `-r`) tells it to print out just the filenames instead.m\\\"\\n\",\n",
