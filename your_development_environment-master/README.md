## Student Requirements

Before this lesson, you should have completed...

- The prework
- The installation steps [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_LuwDxply5VbLbl3p6rX2BiGjy3wSRzqdXtNSyxw3Ew/edit#)

## Learning Objectives

**Note:** This lesson and the next overlap significantly with the prework. We have found that many of our students need to see these fundamental concepts more than once in order to succeed in this course. Please bear with us if the course seems too basic at this point. Don't worry, it will get harder soon enough!

After this lesson, you should be able to...

### Command Line

- Create folders and files using the command line (`mkdir`, `touch`).
- Change directories and list directory content (`cd`, `ls`).
- Check the current working directory (`pwd`).

### Python Development Environments

Describe the pros and cons of using REPLs, notebooks, text editors, and IDEs for code development.

### Git and GitHub

- Use common Git commands: `init`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`, and `clone`.
- Distinguish among (1) file directory, (2) staging area, (3) local repository, and (4) remote repository.
- Explain why Git commits are manual and repository-level rather than file-level.

## Assignments to Complete Before Next Session

- Get ready for the [Unit 1 Project](https://git.generalassemb.ly/gandenberger-part-time-data-science/unit1_project) by downloading it, initializing a new Git repo in it, creating an initial commit, and pushing it to your personal GitHub account.
- Do additional tasks from the "Between Classes" section of the course info doc as appropriate.
