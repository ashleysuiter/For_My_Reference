## Student Requirements

Before this lesson, you should be able to manipulate Python lists.

## Learning Objectives

After this lesson, you should be able to...

- Compute dot products, matrix multiplications, and vector norms by hand and using NumPy.
- Code summary statistics using NumPy and Pandas: mean, median, mode, max, min, quartile, inter-quartile range, variance, standard deviation, and correlation.
- Create basic data visualizations, including scatter plots, box plots, and histograms.
- Identify a normal distribution within a dataset using summary statistics and data visualizations.
