## Student Requirements

Before this lesson, you should be able to...

- Load, explore, and manipulate data using Pandas
- Create simple visualizations with Matplotlib
- Interpret statistical information from box and scatter plots

## Learning Objectives

After this lesson, you should be able to use scikit-learn to build KNN models and evaluate classification model fit.
