## Student Requirements

Before this lesson, you should be able to name and describe common Python data types.

## Learning Objectives

After this lesson, you should be able to describe the strengths and weaknesses of Python and perform the following tasks in Python:

- Create and manipulate integers, strings, tuples, lists, and dictionaries.
- Assign values to variables.
- Import objects from installed modules.
- Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` blocks to control program flow.
- Use `for` and `while` loops to control program flow.
- Use `try` and `except` statements to handle errors.
- Encapsulate blocks of code in functions.

## Lesson Modules

1. [Types](./modules/types.ipynb)
1. [Control Flow](./modules/control_flow.ipynb)
1. [Iterators](./modules/iterators.ipynb)

## Assignments to Complete Before Next Session

- Start working on the [Unit 1 Project](https://git.generalassemb.ly/gandenberger-part-time-data-science/unit1_project).
- Do additional tasks from the "Between Classes" section of the course info doc as appropriate. This lesson is quite foundational, so spending time with the additional resources below is highly recommended, particularly if you did not come into the course with programming experience.

## Additional Resources

In addition to the external resources listed below, in this and most lesson repositories there is a `practice` directory with additional exercises for practice.
