## Student Requirements

Before this lesson, you should be able to...

- Load in and perform basic analysis and manipulation on data in Pandas 
- Build and interpret a linear regression model
- Explain the basics of probability
- Distinguish between continuous and categorical variables
- Explain the bias-variance tradeoff

## Learning Objectives

After this lesson, you should be able to...

- Demonstrate why logistic regression is a better alternative for classification than linear regression.
- Understand the concepts of probability, odds, e, log, and log-odds in relation to machine learning.
- Explain how logistic regression works.
- Interpret logistic regression coefficients.
- Build a logistic regression model in scikit-learn.
- Use metrics to evaluate classifier models.
- Construct a confusion matrix based on predicted classes.
