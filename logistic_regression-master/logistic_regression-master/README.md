## Student Requirements

Before this lesson, you should be able to...

- Load in and perform basic analysis and manipulation on data in Pandas 
- Build and interpret a linear regression model
- Explain the basics of probability
- Distinguish between continuous and categorical variables
- Explain the bias-variance tradeoff

## Learning Objectives

After this lesson, you should be able to...

- Build a logistic regression model in scikit-learn.
- Interpret logistic regression model parameters.
- Calculate accuracy, precision, and recall from a confusion matrix.
- Tune model threshold probability to maximize its $F_\beta$ score.

- [Evaluating Classification Models](./modules/evaluating_binary_classification_models.ipynb)
 
## Assignments to Complete Before the Next Session

Get a classification dataset from Kaggle. Try logistic regression on it, and use an appropriate $F_\beta$ score to optimize its probability threshold. Use our discussion channel on Slack to report on what you find.
