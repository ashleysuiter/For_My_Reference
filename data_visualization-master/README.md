## Assignments to Complete Before Next Session

Visualize the Ames housing data in a variety of ways, and note any observations about the data that jump out at you. Which variables are skewed, and which are approximately normal? Which are positively correlated with sales price? Which are negatively correlated? Which are non-linearly related to it? Which appear to be more or less independent of it? Do you see anything that surprises you?

## Additional Resources

Matplotlib did not make much sense to me until I read these two articles:

- [Effectively Using Matplotlib](http://pbpython.com/effective-matplotlib.html)
- [Python Plotting With Matplotlib (Guide)](https://realpython.com/python-matplotlib-guide/)

Beautiful d3 examples that are also helpful introductions to the topic of Unit 3:

- [Visual Introduction to Machine Learning -- Part 1](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/)
- [Visual Introduction to Machine Learning -- Part 2](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-2/)
