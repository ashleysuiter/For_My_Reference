## Student Requirements

Before this lesson, you should already be able to...

- Perform basic data analysis in Pandas.
- Create basic visualizations with Pandas and Matplotlib.

## Learning Objectives

After this lesson, you will be able to...

- Explain the distinction between causation and correlation and why it matters.
- Identify what missing data is and how to handle it.
- Define "p-value" and "confidence interval."
- Enumerate the steps of constructing and carrying out a hypothesis test.
