## Student Requirements

Before this lesson, you should be able to...

- Build and evaluate classification models in sklearn
- Explain how and when to apply different resampling methods
- Define the concepts of cross-validation and overfitting

## Learning Objectives

After this lesson, you should be able to...

- Explain how a decision tree is created.
- Build a decision tree model in scikit-learn.
- Tune a decision tree model and explain how tuning impacts the model.
- Interpret a tree diagram.
- Describe the key differences between regression and classification trees.
- Decide whether or not a decision tree is an appropriate model for a given problem.

## Lesson Module

[Decision Trees](modules/decision_trees.ipynb)

## Follow-up Steps

Try decision tree regression and classification on some datasets, e.g. from Kaggle. Use our discussion channel on Slack to report on what you find.
