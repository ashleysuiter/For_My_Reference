    "Excel tends to show the data and hides the code, while programming languages tend to show the code and hide the data. Excel is fantastic for non-mission-critical work with data with fairly simple logic.\n",

    "Programming languages such as Python have a number of advantages over GUI tools for machine learning and other data work:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flexibility:** Standard programming languages are [Turing Complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness), so they can (in principle) solve any problem that can be solved with a computer.\n",
    "- **Performance:** Numerical computing libraries such as NumPy for Python are highly optimized for speed and memory efficiency. If that's not enough, you can drop down to a lower-level language for further optimizations and/or run many jobs in parallel across multiple computers. By contrast, Excel doesn't even let you look at more than medium-sized data.\n",
    "- **Extensibility:** Anyone in the world can create and publish a package that extends the language. As a result, the package ecosystem for doing data science in Python is incredible, and it is constantly improving.\n",
    "- **Transparency and Reproducibility:** When you use code to analyze data, that code serves as a record of exactly what you did. Having such a record makes it easier to catch errors and to apply the same steps to new data. By contrast, [Excel is notoriously good at hiding errors](https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/17/4234136/excel-calculation-error-infamous-economic-study).\n",
    "- **Deployability:** Code can be set up to run automatically, e.g. to create scheduled reports or to recommend products on a website in real time.\n",
    "- **Version Control:** Code can be put into a version control system so that you can inspect how it has changed over time and roll it back when something goes wrong.\n",
    "- **Cost:** Python is free."
